        Just a boy caught up in dreams and fantasies
        Please, see me
        Reaching out for someone I can't see
        Take my hand
        Let's see where we wake up tomorrow
        Best laid plans
        Sometimes are just a one night stand
        I'll be damned
        Cupid's demanding back his arrow
        So let's get drunk on our tears

      <div class="TextCenter">And, God, tell us the reason
        Youth is wasted on the young
        It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run
        Searching for meaning
        But are we all lost stars
        Trying to light up the dark?
        Who are we?
        Just a speck of dust within the galaxy

        If we're not careful turns into reality
        Don't you dare let our best memories bring you sorrow
        Yesterday I saw a lion kiss a deer
        Turn the page
        Maybe we'll find a brand new ending
        we're dancing in our tears
        And, God, tell us the reason
        Youth is wasted on the young
